The Clinical Trial Data Processor is a system that processes clinical trial data in JSON format. It validates the input data against a predefined schema, transforms it into the appropriate data models, and stores the processed data into a database using Entity Framework Core. The application ensures that clinical trial records conform to the required business rules and database schema before storage.
